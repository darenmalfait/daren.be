You can preserve the changes you want to undo using the soft flag. You'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.

```shell
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

If you don't want to keep these changes, use the --hard flag. Be sure to do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.

```shell
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```



## Oops, I didn't mean to

If you reset a bit too much, you can redo the last step using:

```shell
git reset 'HEAD@{1}'
```
