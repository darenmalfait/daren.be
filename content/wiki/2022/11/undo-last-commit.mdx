Using the soft flag, you can preserve the changes you want to undo. You'll find the changes as uncommitted local modifications in your working copy.

```powershell
git reset--soft HEAD~1
```

If you don't want to keep these changes, use the --hard flag. Be sure to do this when you're sure you don't need these changes anymore.

```powershell
git reset--hard HEAD~1
```
