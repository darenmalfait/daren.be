  Snippet for a flexible useReducer in React.js

This contains a snippet for a flexible way of using useReducer. I tend to use this if my component has a lot of states. It's cleaner than `useState`.

This code is a React component that uses the useReducer hook to manage the state.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react' // import React and its hooks

const initialState = { // store initial state
  key: "value",
};

function Component() {
  const [store, setStore] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState); // useReducer hook

  function updateStore(values) { // update store function
    setStore(values);
  }

  return <div />
}

function reducer(state, newState) { // reducer function to update store
  return { ...state, ...newState };
}
```
