## Setup

The Doppler CLI provides access to your secrets in every environment, from local development, CI/CD, staging, and production.&#x20;

```shell
# Prerequisite. gnupg is required for binary signature verification
brew install gnupg

# Next, install using brew (use `doppler update` for subsequent updates)
brew install dopplerhq/cli/doppler
```

Now, verify the Doppler CLI was installed by checking its version.

```shell
doppler update
```

For the Doppler CLI to access secrets for your projects, it needs an access token. For local development, we use the doppler login command which will open a browser window and ask you to authenticate

```shell
doppler login
```



## CLI

### Init

```shell
# Select project and config
doppler setup
```

### Uploading to doppler

```shell
doppler secrets upload .env -c dev
```



### Downloading from doppler

```shell
doppler secrets download --no-file --format env -c dev -p project-name  > .env
```
