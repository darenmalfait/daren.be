_body: "Equilibra just launched its new website. It's one of the first websites I created using the Remix with Sanity stack. I love developing with Remix, mainly because the development flow is smooth.\n\nYou can see the website at [https://www.equilibra-deerlijk.be](https://www.equilibra-deerlijk.be).\n\nThe website runs fast, with lighthouse scores above 90. Remix powers the website behind the hood, and the CMS system is Sanity.\n\n![equilibra lighthouse scores](http://res.cloudinary.com/darenmalfait/image/upload/v1667634778/equilibra-lighthouse-scores_wzxatv.png \"equilibra lighthouse scores\")\n\nOne of the challenges for Equilibra was the fact they have a lot of different treatments and prices. So it was essential to maintain the overview and clearly show the costs to those looking for them. So we talked things through, and it was clear that there are different kinds of treatments, so we grouped them.\n\nThe inspiration for pricing came from how many software products show their pricing because they usually have a way of showing prices that is easy to compare different tiers of pricing. So those are things that are important for Equilibra as well.&#x20;\n\n![Equilibra pricing](http://res.cloudinary.com/darenmalfait/image/upload/v1667634854/equilibra-pricing-screenshot_blbmrz.png \"Equilibra pricing\")\n\nI'm happy with how the website turned out, and most importantly, the customer is too. \U0001F44D\n\nDo you like how this website turned out? Or do you want to talk about it?\n\n<Button text=\"Get in touch\" variant=\"primary\" href=\"contact\" />\n"
