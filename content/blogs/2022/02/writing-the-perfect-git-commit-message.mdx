  "Commit messages to come in all forms and sizes. Clean git history is not a
  priority in many codebases, but don't be mistaken. It is essential. It is a
  way to keep your commit messages uniform and easy to read.\n\n[Conventional
  commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) are a way of writing
  commit messages that have been around for a long time. And here is an example
  of what one looks like:\n\n```markdown\nfeat(scope): add magical
  unicorn\n^--^^-----^  ^------------------^\n|       |              |\n|       |              +->
  Summary in present tense. Starting with add, remove, update, do. Think about:
  If I commit this, my code would .... add magical
  unicorn\n|       |\n|       +-> optional scope of the commit, component-name,
  container\n|\n+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or
  test.\n```\n\n## Commit type\n\nThe developer should write the commit from the
  user's perspective, not the developer's. Slight nuance, but it makes a
  difference.\n\n* \\`feat\\`: New feature for the user (not a feature to the
  code, or ci, ...)&#x20;\n* \\`fix\\`:  Bugfix for the user (not a fix to build
  something, ...)\n* \\`docs\\`: Changes to the documentation\n* \\`style\\`:
  This could be the styling of the code or styling changes in general. Does not
  change any functionality.\n* \\`refactor\\`: Refactoring production code. For
  example: Renaming a variable\n* \\`test\\`: Only changes current or new tests.
  Does not change the production code\n* \\`chore\\`: Does not impact
  production.\n\n## Scope (optional)\n\nYou may provide a scope after a type,
  but it must consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase.
  feat(datepicker):\n\n## The commit message\n\nWriting a good commit message is
  food for discussion, and according to conventional commits (and myself), you
  should write the commit message in the present time.\n\nAn excellent way to
  write a message is to fill in the sentence:\n\nIf I commit my code, it will
  ... (add a magical unicorn)feat(forest): add a magical unicorn\n\n## The
  message body (optional)\n\nWe have covered most ways of writing commit
  messages, but a message body can still be filled in.\n\nThe body can include
  the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behaviour.\n\n*
  The body is the place to mention issue identifiers and their
  relations\n\nExample \\`closes #33\\`\n\n### The body footer (optional)\n\nThe
  footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes.\n\nBreaking
  Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGES: followed by space or two
  newlines.\n\nA breaking change can be part of commits of any
  type.\n\n```markdown\nfeat(forest): add magical unicorn\n\nclose
  #1337\nBREAKING CHANGES: We removed horses, because they don't get
  allong\n```\n\n## Semantic versioning\n\n1. fix: a commit of the type\_fix
  patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic
  Versioning).\n2. feat: a commit of the type\_feat introduces a new feature to
  the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\n3. BREAKING
  CHANGE: a commit that has a footer, or appends  ! after the type/scope,
  introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic
  Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.\n\n"
