summary: |
  I designed a modern, responsive website for By Hans Depla to effectively showcase their vehicles and services. The previous site lacked maintainability and adaptability for different devices, which hindered usability. The new website solves these issues and ensures seamless navigation across all platforms.

  The main focus was on making it easy for Hans to manage the vehicle inventory. With an intuitive interface, it's now simple to add, edit, and remove vehicles, saving time and effort. Each vehicle listing is visually appealing and informative, enhancing the browsing experience for customers.

  Additionally, the site highlights their services such as repairs, rentals, and custom welding work. The clean layout and responsive design ensure visitors can quickly find information. This modern approach positions By Hans Depla as a professional, customer-focused business.
