summary: |
  When putting your brand on clothing, it's crucial to get the design just right. I'm here to help you navigate the design process and ensure your branding looks great on whatever clothing you choose. I work with you to make informed decisions and guide you through the options, so you have confidence in what you're ordering.

  ## How I Can Help:

  - Design Guidance for Clothing: Not sure which style or type of clothing works best with your brand? I'll guide you through the options and provide expert advice on what will look great, whether it's t-shirts, hoodies, or caps.
  - Custom Designs for Your Brand: I take your branding and create a custom design that matches your vision and looks sharp on clothing. We consider factors like fabric, logo placement, and design size to ensure your brand is beautifully displayed.
  - Help Choosing the Right Printing Method: Different designs work better with certain printing methods, such as embroidery, screen printing, or heat transfer. I'll help you determine which method best suits your design so it comes out exactly as you want.
  - Mockups for Confidence: Before you place an order, I create mockups so you can see exactly how your design will look on the clothing. This helps you make adjustments if needed and ensures you're happy with the final result.
