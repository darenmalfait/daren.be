Equilibra just launched its new website. It's one of the first websites I
created using the Remix with Sanity stack. I love developing with Remix, mainly
because the development flow is smooth.

You can see the website at
[https://www.equilibra-deerlijk.be](https://www.equilibra-deerlijk.be).

The website runs fast, with lighthouse scores above 90. Remix powers the website
behind the hood, and the CMS is Sanity.

One of the challenges for Equilibra was the fact they have numerous different
treatments and prices. So it was essential to maintain the overview and clearly
show the costs to those looking for them. So we talked things through, and it
was clear that there are different kinds of treatments, so we grouped them.

The inspiration for pricing came from how many software products show their
pricing because they usually have a way of showing prices that is easy to
compare different tiers of pricing. These factors are important for
Equilibra as well.

I'm happy with how the website turned out, and most importantly, the customer is
too.

Do you like how this website turned out? Or do you want to talk about it?
