The website for Kapsalon Lieve was designed with simplicity in mind, focusing on providing essential information for customers. The goal was to create a clean, easy-to-navigate site where visitors could quickly find the services offered and contact details. By keeping the design minimalistic, we ensured that the user experience remained straightforward and efficient, making it easy for potential clients to reach out without any distractions.

Given that the client only needed basic information, the website structure was kept simple yet effective. I included sections for the salon's services, such as haircuts, styling, and coloring, along with essential contact information. A user-friendly contact form was integrated to make it easy for customers to inquire about services or schedule appointments. This approach ensures that the website serves its primary purpose without unnecessary complexity.

Since many users browse from their mobile devices, the website was designed to be fully responsive, ensuring that it functions smoothly on all screen sizes. The layout adapts well to mobile, making it easy for visitors to access the contact details and reach out to the salon on the go. The website was also optimized for fast loading times, ensuring a seamless experience for users whether they are on a desktop or a smartphone.
