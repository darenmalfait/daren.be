      ## Who I Am


      With over a decade of experience in web development, I specialize in
      building custom, high-performance websites and applications. As a
      freelance engineer, I focus on delivering exceptional front-end
      experiences with React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and modern frameworks like
      Next.js and Gatsby.


      I’m passionate about clean, responsive design, fast loading times, and
      user-centric development that drives results for my clients. I work
      closely with businesses and agencies to create unique, visually engaging
      web solutions that are as functional as they are beautiful.

      JavaScript libraries, frameworks, custom plugins, features, animations,
      and coding interactive layouts.


      I have also full-stack developer experience and most of all, I have a big
      interest in learning and I'm not scared of tackling new languages and
      challenges.

      ## The balance between code and life


      As a developer, I spend much of my day sitting at a desk, immersed in
      building seamless web experiences. But I strongly believe that to perform
      at my best, maintaining a healthy balance is essential. That’s why I
      prioritize physical activity like cycling and running in my free time.
      These activities not only help me stay fit but also provide a refreshing
      mental reset, enabling me to return to work with renewed focus and
      creativity.


      For me, exercise is more than just a routine—it’s a way to ensure I’m
      sharp, motivated, and able to bring my best to every project. Cycling
      through nature or running after a long workday gives me the clarity and
      energy to approach challenges with a fresh perspective. This balance helps
      me remain productive while delivering exceptional results for my clients.
