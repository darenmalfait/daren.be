      includes:


      * Clean and Minimalist Layouts: Simplifying the design to focus on what
      matters most: your content and message.

      from desktops to smartphones, ensuring your site looks and works perfectly
      no matter where it’s viewed.

      * Intuitive Navigation: Making it easy for your visitors to find what
